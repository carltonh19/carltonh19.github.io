So far, I think I'm enjoying programming in Javascript, and so far I think Javascript is very much the same as java, python, C, etc. But not quite the same, probably because it's a new language to learn, and the experience of programming in Javascript is more comfortable than in other languages. If I am a complete novice, Javascript is more comfortable than other programming languages I know, and I feel Javascript is more flexible. From a software engineering perspective, I think Javascript is an excellent programming language.On this basis, I am looking forward to the interaction of Html and CSS with Javascript. Since my interests are front end, I also hope that I can master Javascript and other front end languages smoothly.
