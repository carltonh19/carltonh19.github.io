Before I went to high school, or before my sophomore year, I wanted my college major to be in art drawing and painting and all that, because before I went to high school I was exposed to a lot of different styles of drawing and painting, such as sketching, watercolors, anime, and so on. But in my senior year of high school, I was introduced to programming, python, and I realized that I was having fun with python, and I felt like I could do a lot of things I wanted to do with programming. Therefore, I am determined to pursue a career in the computer industry in the future.
Currently I am interested in the front-end side of the field, such as UI design. I prefer to bring some design elements in it. This includes the design and programming of things like games, and I have fantasized about having games of my own design.
I hope that I can acquire skills related to UI design and game design in the future, and I also hope that I can do internships in some companies or businesses related to UI design and game design.
