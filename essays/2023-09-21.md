At first my concept of coding standards was vague, I tended to think of it as a standard making it possible for more people to understand what each other's code was about. But I've found that it does, and on top of that, coding standards make the codes all uniform, formatting-wise, and aesthetically even more uniform, making them better to read and understand. After using ESLint this week, I think ESLint is very powerful, he can go for me to automatically correct the format, and may even be able to help me solve some problems. But sometimes ESLint will just alert me that there is an error and show me a red cross, without reminding me how to fix it. This is often what bothers me as well. I find getting green checkmarks to be painful, and sometimes's an extra space will remind you that there's an error here, which I find very annoying. But overall, I think coding standards are necessary, and standardizing coding formats makes it better and faster for everyone to understand each other's code.
